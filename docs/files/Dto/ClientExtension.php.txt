 * (permissions) that a particular client application can request. In this
 * case, it is meaningless if the developer of the client application can
 * freely decide the set of requestable scopes. It is not the developer of
 * the client application but the administrator of the authorization server
 * that should be allowed to define the set of scopes that the client
